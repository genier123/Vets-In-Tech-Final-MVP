            <h2>Owens Challenges Tyler Robinsonâ€™s Role</h2>
            <p>In a recent episode of her podcast, Candace Owens presented a new theory regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA. Owens claims that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of the crime, was wrongly framed. She asserts that the official narrative provided by federal authorities is deceptive and that Robinson maintains his innocence.</p>

            <h2>Disputing Key Case Findings</h2>
            <p>Owens disputes several key findings in the case, including allegations that Robinson was suicidal. She contends that these elements are fabricated to support a false narrative. According to Owens, the media and federal officials are lying about the circumstances surrounding Kirk's death.</p>

            <h2>Earlier Speculations and Controversy</h2>
            <p>This theory follows Owens' earlier speculation involving Israel and financier Bill Ackman. She suggested that Kirk was pressured into adopting a pro-Israel stance and that his assassination was linked to these pressures. These claims have been widely criticized and denied by the individuals and entities involved.</p>

            <h2>Conservative Community Response</h2>
            <p>The spread of such conspiracy theories has sparked controversy within the conservative community. Some, like Kirk's pastor, have rebuked Owens for promoting unverified claims, urging a more respectful and evidence-based approach to discussing Kirk's death.</p>
