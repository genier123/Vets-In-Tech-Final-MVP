                Using an email list is one on the unpopular practices when an artist first thinks about getting their music out there to new fans. 
                This is a database of email addresses used by an artist or promoter to send marketing material and new music and merch to multiple fans.
                The total amount of subscribers you have, which basically known as “the mailing list”, or “subscriber’s list”. You can use services such as mailchimp <i>[link at the bottom]</i> and others although mailchimp offers a free plan which may be usefull for a beginner artist. 
                This is a great startig point. Remember do not spam your recipients as gmail and other mail service will detect this.

                Whether you like to admit it or not, we as humans are visual creatures. What does this mean for you as the artist? 
                It means that if you have any type of chance to capture a potential new fan, one way of doing this is with visualizers, lyric or just in general a really good music video. 
                We advise you put out all three, starting with a visualizer, then a lyrical video, then an actual music video telling a story.

                There is no dought about it, you need album art for every single song you release to be a either consistant, controversial, or something so outrageous that the average person will have the curiousity to click that play button. 
                Make sure the art looks clear, bright and also meets the visual guidelines of streaming platforms. Think of this as your resume, so you want to get a design that resinates with the fans that you are looking to capture. We recommend Fiverr <i>[link below]</i> for a nice album art.

                Social media ads are not as complicated as a lot of promoters and indie artists think. 
                If you are social media savy it should be no issue for you, especially if you go on youtube and search for tutorials on Instagram and do not forget Facebook. 
                One thing that we suggest is if you run ads get highly familiar with <i>retargeting ads</i>.

                Spaming is not anything new and if you think it is you are in for a huge suprise.
                Basically you are sending unwanted content to multiple poeple and it can give you a horrible reputation in the social media world. 
                Have you ever had that annoying artist psam you every day, in addition its the same song?  
                Also remmeber this is a way to get your accounts banned from social media platforms, and if we are talking about emails it can be more serious.
                Signing up for an email subscription seems great at first but when you come to find out that your getting two to three emails a day every day, thats spam.
                DO NOT BE THIS GUY! Make your updates count. We recommend sending something no more more then twice a week unless it's important.
                Remember the more scarce something is, the more valuable it is.
