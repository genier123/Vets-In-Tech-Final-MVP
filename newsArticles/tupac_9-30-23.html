                <p><i>Hot Club Tracks Staff - September 29, 2023</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>Las Vegas, NV (AP) — A significant development has unfolded in one of hip-hop's most enduring mysteries as a man suspected of orchestrating the 1996 killing of rapper Tupac Shakur has finally been apprehended and charged with murder.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Duane "Keffe D" Davis</strong>, who has long been under the scrutiny of investigators as one of the four initial suspects identified in the case, faces murder charges, despite not being the alleged gunman. In a news conference and during court proceedings on Friday, authorities labeled him as the ringleader of the group. Under Nevada law, individuals can be charged with a crime, including murder, if they assist in its commission.</p>
                <br>
                <p>According to Las Vegas police homicide Lt. Jason Johansson, "Duane Davis was the shot caller for this group of individuals that committed this crime, and he orchestrated the plan that was carried out." Davis himself has openly admitted in interviews and revealed in his 2019 memoir, "Compton Street Legend," that he provided the firearm used in the drive-by shooting. Authorities stated that Davis's public statements reignited interest in the case.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The 60-year-old Davis was taken into custody early Friday while out for a walk near his residence on the outskirts of Las Vegas. This arrest coincided with the announcement by prosecutors in court that a Nevada grand jury had indicted the self-proclaimed "gangster" on a single count of murder with a deadly weapon. He is expected to appear in court next week.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Furthermore, the grand jury voted to include a sentencing enhancement for gang activity alongside the murder charge, potentially adding up to 20 more years to his sentence if convicted.</p>
