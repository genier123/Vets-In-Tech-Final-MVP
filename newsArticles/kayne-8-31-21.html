                        Kanye West wore a complete face mask to host three livestreamed listening sessions for his new album, Yeezy Season 10.
                        He didn't say anything else, and he didn't even tweet.
                        After years of upsetting loyal fans with forays into conservative politics and often tedious media spectacle, pop's King of All Controversy largely let the music speak for itself with the release of <i>"Donda."</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a prickly, personal divorce album full of introspection, conflicting emotions, and bursts of musical innovation, in the vein of <i>Marvin Gaye's "Here, My Dear"</i> or <i>Phil Collins "Face Value."</i>
                        In addition to the church organ, there is drill music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kanye's earnest praise of God  "he's done miracles on me" mixed in with Old Kanye's witty self-awareness: "I'll be honest, we're all liars."
                        “I regret for everything I'm going to do again.”
                        There are references to reggae icon Buju Banton, rap luminaries JAY-Z, The LOX, and Jay Electronica, as well as several barbs at longstanding foe Drake.
                        Its 27 tracks total one hour and 49 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Donda received harsh criticism from Power 105's DJ Evny, the pengalum has swung both ways with most the hip-hop community. We at Hot Club Tracks enjoyed <i>"OK OK", "Praise God", "Jail" and "Come To Life"</i> and know that Kanye Always has something up his sleeve for the people that did not apporve of this album.
