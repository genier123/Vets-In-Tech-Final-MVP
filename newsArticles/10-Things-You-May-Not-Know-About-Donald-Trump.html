            <br>
            <p>Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is a figure who has captivated the public for decades, both in and out of the political arena. While much of his life has been lived in the public eye, there are some surprising aspects of his personality, career, and background that might not be as well known. Here are ten things you may not know about Donald Trump:</p>
            <br>
            <h2>1. A Military School Background</h2>
            <p>Before attending college, Donald Trump was sent to the New York Military Academy at the age of 13. His parents believed the disciplined environment would channel his energy and build character. Trump later credited the academy with instilling in him the values of discipline and leadership.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>2. A Successful Reality TV Career</h2>
            <p>While many know Trump from his political career, his time as the host and executive producer of the reality TV show "The Apprentice" significantly boosted his public profile. The show, which ran from 2004 to 2017, made "You're fired!" a catchphrase and introduced Trump to a new generation of Americans.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>3. An Early WrestleMania Appearance</h2>
            <p>Trump made a surprising foray into the world of professional wrestling in 2007, when he participated in a storyline with WWE owner Vince McMahon. Their feud culminated in the "Battle of the Billionaires" at WrestleMania 23, where Trump famously shaved McMahon’s head after his representative won the match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>4. A Passion for Golf</h2>
            <p>Donald Trump is an avid golfer and owns a number of golf courses around the world. He’s often seen on the golf course, and his love for the sport has led to Trump-branded golf resorts in locations such as Scotland, Ireland, and the United States.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>5. A Long-Standing Interest in Politics</h2>
            <p>Though his entry into politics seemed sudden, Trump had expressed interest in running for president as early as the late 1980s. He flirted with the idea in 2000 as a potential candidate for the Reform Party and made several public statements about his political ambitions long before his 2016 campaign.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>6. A Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</h2>
            <p>Trump was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007 for his work on "The Apprentice." The star has become a symbol of his crossover success from business to entertainment and has been both a point of pride and controversy over the years.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>7. Authorship of Best-Selling Books</h2>
            <p>Donald Trump is a best-selling author, with his 1987 book "The Art of the Deal" being one of the most famous business books of its time. The book provides insights into his business strategies and personal philosophy, and it played a significant role in shaping his public image as a dealmaker.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>8. A Philanthropic History</h2>
            <p>Despite the controversies surrounding his charitable activities, Trump has a history of philanthropy, having donated millions to various causes over the years. He has supported veterans, education, health care, and other initiatives through both direct donations and fundraising efforts.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>9. A Diverse Business Empire</h2>
            <p>Trump’s business ventures extend far beyond real estate. Over the years, his brand has been associated with a wide range of products, including steaks, bottled water, vodka, a board game, and even a short-lived university. His name has been both a selling point and a point of contention in various markets.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>10. A Presidential Campaign Unlike Any Other</h2>
            <p>Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign broke many norms of American politics. He ran as an outsider, capitalizing on widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment. His unorthodox approach, including his use of social media and rally speeches, resonated with a large portion of the electorate, leading to his unexpected victory.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Donald Trump’s life and career are marked by a series of bold moves, unconventional choices, and a flair for the dramatic. Whether admired or criticized, his impact on American culture and politics is undeniable. These lesser-known aspects of his life add further complexity to the story of one of the most talked-about figures of the 21st century.</p>
