                        Isaac Freeman III, widely known as Fatman Scoop, the rapper and hype man celebrated for his 1999 hit "Be Faithful," has passed away at the age of 53. Fatman Scoop, whose booming voice and infectious energy made him a beloved figure in the music industry, died after collapsing on stage during a performance on Friday night in Connecticut.

                        The tragic incident occurred at Hamden Town Center Park, where Fatman Scoop was performing when he experienced a medical emergency. The news was confirmed by Hamden's Mayor, Lauren Garrett, in a post on Facebook. Although the cause of death has not been disclosed, his talent agency, MN2S, confirmed his passing to Variety on Saturday.

                        In a statement, MN2S CEO Sharron Elkabas expressed the profound loss felt by the music community, saying, "Scoop was a beloved figure in the music world, whose work was loved by countless fans across the globe. His iconic voice, infectious energy, and great personality made an indelible mark on the industry, and his legacy will live on through his timeless music."

                        Fatman Scoop's family also took to social media to honor his memory, sharing their grief and celebrating his life. "Last night, the world lost a radiant soul, a beacon of light on the stage and in life," they wrote on his official Instagram page. They described him as "the laughter in our lives, a constant source of support, unwavering strength, and courage."

                        Fatman Scoop's influence on the music industry was undeniable. He shot to fame with "Be Faithful," a track featuring and produced by the hip-hop duo Crooklyn Clan, which topped the singles charts in the U.K. and Ireland upon its re-release in 2003. His collaborations with major artists like Mariah Carey and Missy Elliott further cemented his place in the industry. Notably, his feature on Elliott's "Lose Control" won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video and earned a nomination for Best Rap Song.

                        Missy Elliott paid tribute to her longtime collaborator on X (formerly Twitter), writing, "Prayers for Fatman Scoop's family for STRENGTH during this difficult time. Fatman Scoop's VOICE & energy have contributed to MANY songs that made the people feel HAPPY & want to dance for over 2 decades. Your IMPACT is HUGE & will NEVER be forgotten."

                        In addition to his past successes, Fatman Scoop continued to make music until his untimely passing. His most recent collaboration was with rapper Tech N9ne on the single "No Popcorn," which was released in July of this year.
