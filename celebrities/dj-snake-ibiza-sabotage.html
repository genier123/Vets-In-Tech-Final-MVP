            <p>
              Witnesses describe the music cutting out multiple times before the lights flickered and Snake himself stormed off the stage mid-drop. Moments later, crew rushed out and signaled the crowd the show was over. Fans said the energy went from euphoric to chaotic in seconds.

            <p>
              Anonymous sources close to the production allege that wires in his setup were tampered with hours before the performance. Some even suggest rival DJs had a hand in the chaos fueling a wildfire of conspiracy theories in the EDM community.

            <h2>What’s Next</h2>
            <p>
              - Will DJ Snake address the sabotage rumors directly?<br>
              - Will Ibiza venues tighten security around headline acts?<br>
              - Could this ignite new rivalries in the already competitive EDM world?<br>
              - And was this really an attack or just a freak tech failure amplified by gossip?
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              Whether the Ibiza collapse was sabotage, stress, or something in between, it’s the kind of story that has the music world buzzing. Until DJ Snake speaks out, speculation will only keep building and fans around the globe are waiting for answers.
